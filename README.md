<h1 align="center">Eugene Duodu (Dee for Short) 👋</h1>
**Senior Full Stack Engineer • Problem Solver • AI Enthusiast**

A pragmatic engineer bridging legacy systems and modern stacks. I build reliable, low-friction tools—often AI-augmented—that help teams and products move faster while keeping things clear, simple, and maintainable.

## 🚀 About
With 7+ years of consistent experience, I’ve shipped and stabilized systems across domains: medical & health platforms, music applications, insurance & investment systems, browser & VSCode extensions, blockchain integrations, and AI tooling (including quantized models, chatbots, and voice/transcription interfaces). I’m passionate about exploring new tech (TikTok dev, small-footprint AI, automation), but I start with understanding the problem—simplicity and clarity drive the best solutions. I enjoy turning complex flows into something any new developer can pick up and extend.

## 💡 Philosophy
I believe solving the right problem is more important than writing clever code. Clear communication, minimal cognitive overhead, and tooling that scales with people—not just systems—are foundational. I automate repetitive work, surface real value early, and keep designs approachable for collaborators.
