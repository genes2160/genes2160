<h3 align="center">Senior Full Stack Engineer from Ghana</h3>

## Snapshot
Problem-first engineer with 7+ years of experience building, stabilizing, and modernizing systems across domains: medical, music, insurance, investment, blockchain, and extensibility platforms (browser/VSCode). I bridge legacy and modern‚ÄîPHP/WordPress to Python and TypeScript‚Äîwhile keeping solutions simple, understanding problems deeply, and making onboarding easy for others. Strong believer in human+AI collaboration: deploying quantized models, building chatbots, transcription/voice interfaces, and tooling that augments work without friction.

## Core Expertise
- **Domains:** Healthcare apps, music platforms, insurance systems, investment tooling, blockchain projects, browser extensions, VSCode integrations.  
- **Tech Stack:** Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, PHP, React, Vue, Postgres, MongoDB, Redis, Docker, Nginx/Apache.  
- **Approach:** Problem decomposition over premature coding, clear communication, minimal friction automation, legacy-to-modern transformations, and pragmatic AI augmentation.  
- **Interests:** AI (lightweight/quantized models, Hugging Face, voice command & transcription), TikTok development, extension ecosystems, real-time tooling, and continuous learning.

## What Drives Me
- Cloning and improving real-world apps to understand patterns deeply.  
- Making complex systems approachable: clean processes, readable code, and easy handoffs.  
- Exploring the intersection of human workflows and intelligent automation.  
- Collaborating with people who value clarity, honesty, and durable solutions.

## Hobbies & Extras
Sightseeing, photography, contributing to open tooling (e.g., Google-related), experimenting with voice/command interfaces, building and refining developer experiences.
